Future plans:
1) Assigning existing pronoun set(s) to yourself.
2) Searching pronoun use by username.
3) Allow users to choose their pronouns as a reaction to a roles message & update roles message to include user-added pronoun sets.
4) Assign server roles based on self-assigned pronoun sets.
5) Implement message pronoun substitution into a slash command.
6) Choose user to grab pronouns from for message substitution. Currently you must supply the pronouns to swap to and from.
7) Allow for message substitution to swap between pronoun sets for users with multiple pronouns listed.
